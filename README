BiCon - The Bidirectional Console
=================================

Dependencies
------------

 - FriBiDi >= 0.10.4 (library AND headers)


Installation
------------

You need the FriBidi library to compile this program. Probably
you have it in your distribution. If not, get it from
http://fribidi.org/ . You can install it via Homebrew as well (works on both Linux and macOS):

``` sh
brew install fribidi
```

Installation is simple, the usual steps:

	./autogen.sh
	./configure
	make
	make install


macOS
-----

Things seem to somewhat work, but:
- The build fails its last step because there is no `psfaddtable` on macOS. This doesn't seem to matter.
  - The built binary can be found at `./bicon/bicon.bin`. 
- Sometimes programs exit abnormally: `[1]    15104 abort      bicon.bin ls`. This also doesn't seem to matter, but you do need to do a `reset` on the terminal after it.
  - I have added a test file that triggers this: `bicon.bin cat ./macOS/test.txt`
- Opening a shell with `bicon` seems to work without problems.

Usage
-----

This program currently can be used under Linux console, or
terminal emulators with basic Unicode rendering support, like
gnome-terminal, xterm, or PuTTY.

Simply run "bicon" to get a console supporting Arabic or Persian.
The language used is chosen according to the LANG environment
variable.

You can also choose the language country by specifying the country on
the country on the command line, e.g ::

	bicon sa          # enables Arabic (Saudi Arabia) support
	bicon ir          # for Persian (Iran)

You can use the alt+shift combination to switch keyboard language.

Of course, you have a man page bicon(1) to check.

Emacs
-----

This works for me:

``` zsh
function bicon-emc() {
  bicon.bin --reshape-only emacsclient -t "$@"
  reset
}
```

Take care not to run this from a shell that is itself running under `bicon`. You need to use this function if you want to do so (you also need the wrappers defined in the [known issues](#Known-Issues) section):

``` zsh
bicon-emc () {
    if isBicon
    then
        {
            (
                emacsclient -t -e "(progn (setq-default bidi-display-reordering nil) (redraw-display))" "$@"
            )
        } always {
            emacsclient -e "(setq-default bidi-display-reordering t)"
        }
        return $?
    fi
    biconm --reshape-only emacsclient -t "$@"
    reset
}
```

And it will still not be good for editing RTL text, as Emacs is confused by the bidi reversal that `bicon` does.

Known Issues
------------

* Text that is soft-wrapped, is vertically inverted. You can wrap the text yourself using, e.g., `command ggrep -Eo ".{1,100}"`, to avoid this problem.
* [Some](https://github.com/behdad/bicon/issues/24) zsh plugins are somewhat incompatible with running under `bicon`:
  * zsh-syntax-highlighting
  * zdharma/fast-syntax-highlighting
  * zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions
  
One workaround is to wrap your invocations of `bicon` in:

``` sh
biconm () {
    BICON_MODE=y bicon.bin "$@"
}
bicon-zsh () {
    biconm zsh
    reset
}
```

Then check if `zsh` is running under `bicon`:

``` sh
isBicon () {
    test -n "$BICON_MODE"
}
if ! isBicon ; then
  antibody bundle zdharma/fast-syntax-highlighting # etc
fi
```
